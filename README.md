# Smart-E-Health-Record-System-and-Decision-Support-System
Developed a Smart E-Record System with an advanced decision support system. Collected data from users via photos of medical documents and voice using the Gemini API, extracting useful information for storage in a MongoDB database. Created a computer vision project using YOLOv8 to calculate the calories of local foods. Predicted disease vulnerability for conditions such as diabetes and heart disease using stored data. Evaluated different models from Scikit-learn, CNN, and RNN, comparing their accuracy. Applied dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, to improve model performance.
